Contributing
---

If you are looking to help to with a code contribution our project uses Python (Django), Javascript, HTML/CSS. If you don't feel ready to make a code contribution yet, feel free to reach out and we can discuss how to get involved!

If you are interested in making a code contribution, have a look at the issues tab to find an existing task or create your own issue that you'd like to work on. Fork this repository and make your code changes. When you're done (or if you want to check in on the direction of your change), create a pull request on Github against this project.

In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!
